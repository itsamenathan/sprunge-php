## What?
I liked [sprunge.us](https://github.com/rupa/sprunge) but I didn't like giving my data away.  So I setup this quick little script.

## Install
* ```git clone https://github.com/itsamenathan/sprunge-php.git``` to a directory being hosted by your webserver
* Move conf.php.dist to conf.php
* edit conf.php with your mysql database info
